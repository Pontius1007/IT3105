GANN:
dims = dimentions. first the input, then the hidden layers(s), then the output layer. f.eks, [768, 16, 16, 10]
lrate = learning rate
cman = caseman
mbs = minibatch size
softmax = True or False according to if you want to softmax your results


Caseman:
cfunc = case generator. Case = [input-vector, target-vector]
A ML "case" is a vector with two elements: the input vector and the output (target) vector.  These are the
high-level functions that should get called from ML code.  They invoke the supporting functions above.

vfrac = validation fraction
tfrac = test fraction

Misc:
epoch: an epoch is one complete presentation of the data set to be learned to a learning machine.
bestk=1: if classification and targets are one-hot vectors. Uses gen_match_counter error function. 
bestk=None : the standard MSE error function is used for testing.
